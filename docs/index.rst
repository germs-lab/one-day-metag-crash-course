Welcome to Metagenomics One Day Crash Course!
=============================================

Contents:

These are the tutorials for a one day course I will teach at Cambridge University in April, 2016.  They are a merge of my perspective of what I wish someone would have showed me in less than 6 hours when I was a total newbie to metagenomic sequencing analysis.

Three main tutorial sections:
-----------------------------------
* :ref:`Unix Shell <shell>`
* :ref:`Getting data <fetch-data>`
* :ref:`Running a program <blast>`

.. _shell:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2 

   shell/index

.. _fetch-data:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   fetch-data/index

.. _blast:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   blast/index
