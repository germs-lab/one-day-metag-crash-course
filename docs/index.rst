Welcome to Metagenomics One Day Crash Course!
=============================================

Contents:

These are the tutorials that are a merge of my perspective of what I wish someone would have showed me in less than 6 hours when I was a total newbie to metagenomic sequencing analysis.

Three main tutorial sections:
-----------------------------------
* :ref:`Unix Shell <shell>`
* :ref:`Getting data <fetch-data>`
* :ref:`Running a program <blast>`
* :ref:`Fungene tutorial and BLASTing again` <blast-fungene>`
