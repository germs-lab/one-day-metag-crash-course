Welcome to Metagenomics One Day Crash Course!
=============================================

Contents:

These are the tutorials for a one day course I will teach at Cambridge University in April, 2016.  They are a merge of my perspective of what I wish someone would have showed me in less than 6 hours when I was a total newbie to metagenomic sequencing analysis.

There three main tutorial sections:

* :ref:`shell`
* :ref:`fetch`
* :ref:`bioinfo`

.. _shell:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2 
   :caption: Shell documentation 

   shell/index

.. _fetch::

.. toctree:
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Fetching data from an API

   fetch-data/index
